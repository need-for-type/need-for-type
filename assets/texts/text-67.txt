There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ship smoke on the horizon. You are only coming through in
waves. Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying. When I was
a child, I had a fever. My hands felt just like two balloons. Now I've
got that feeling once again. I can't explain you will not understand.
This is not how I am.
